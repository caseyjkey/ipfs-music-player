## What moved?

This repository (IPFS Music Player) is now the **featured project** within the **Decentralized-Application-Development** monorepo alongside:
- Crypto arbitrage algorithms (Kraken Arbitrage Challenge)
- Payment experimentation projects (The Payment Pals)

All source code, documentation, and future updates have moved to the monorepo.

## Why?

Consolidating Web3 and blockchain experiments into a focused monorepo for:
- **Easier maintenance** — shared tooling and dependencies
- **Better discoverability** — all decentralized apps in one place
- **Streamlined updates** — single source of truth
